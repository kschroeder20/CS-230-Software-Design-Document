_Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_

This software design was developed to support a game where multiple teams compete to guess a word based on stock images. The application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

_What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_

I conducted a lot of research from multiple different sources that enabled me to put together thorough recommendations at the end of this document. I learned a lot about the beneifts and drawbacks of different operating platforms, how to plan a distributed system, and how to secure a Linux server.

_What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_

I think that the design document is a great first step in deciding what language to program an application in. You can aviod a lot of future frustration if you choose a programming language based on the recmmendations in the design document. Creating a design document also gives developers a chance analyze the purpose of the application before developing, which helps the entire team stay on the same page throughout development.

_If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_

I would like to gain experience in setting up servers on Linux, Mac, and Windows and then revise the table. I think hands-on experience would help me give more details and make a better recommendation.

_How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_

To interpret the user's need I'd use a combination of talking to the client, using our technological expertise, and talking to people who use the exsisting product. It's important to consider the user's needs because a user-friendly application is more likely to become successful.

_How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_

When designing software, I like to get all of the information correct before I begin coding. I like to know what the current state of the product is, what the users like about the app, what the users want to see improved on the app, and what are the technical requirements associated with the task. From there I can determine the architecture and programming language of the application. I will use this technique for designing software in the future.
